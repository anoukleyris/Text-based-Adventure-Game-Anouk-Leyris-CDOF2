# Text-based-Adventure-Game-Anouk-Leyris-CDOF2

A text-based adventure game where the player's decisions define the outcome of the story.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/anoukleyris/Text-based-Adventure-Game-Anouk-Leyris-CDOF2.git

# Prerequisites (for those who want to help me)

Before making any changes, create a fork and a branch with the issue you resolve, where you will modify the code without touching my main branch.

## Running the Tests

Open the code project.py with Visual Studio Code, for example. Launch the code using the "Run" command or by entering "run project.py" in a terminal and start playing!

### Break Down into End-to-End Tests

The game will end when the story is complete.

## main steps: 

Function Definitions:

introduction(): Prints a welcome message and sets the stage for the text adventure.

use_torch(): Describes using a torch to illuminate the path.
eaten(), run(), run2(), left(), right(), turn_back(), surprise(), win(): Different scenarios and outcomes of the story.
exit_game(): Prints a thank-you message and exits the game.
forest_adventure() Function:

Asks the player to make a choice between exploring the forest further or lighting a torch.
If the player chooses to explore, more choices and scenarios unfold, leading to different outcomes based on subsequent choices.
main() Function:

Calls introduction() to set up the story.
Calls forest_adventure() to start the main part of the text adventure.
if __name__ == "__main__": Block:

Checks if the script is being run directly and not imported as a module.
Calls the main() function to start the execution of the text adventure.
The story involves making choices that affect the outcome, with different branches leading to various possible endings. The code uses time.sleep() to introduce delays in the text for a better storytelling experience.
